# Handwritten Digit Classifier

## 📌 Overview
This project is a machine learning model that recognizes handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model fetches the dataset, preprocesses the images, and trains a classifier for digit recognition.

## 📂 Dataset
The project utilizes the **MNIST** dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
- OpenML (Fetching Dataset)
- NumPy & Pandas (Data Handling)
- Matplotlib (Visualization)

## 📊 Steps Involved
1. **Fetching Dataset** – Downloading the MNIST dataset from OpenML
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Normalizing and reshaping images
3. **Model Training** – Using machine learning classifiers to predict digits
4. **Model Evaluation** – Measuring accuracy and performance
